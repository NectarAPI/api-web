          <h5>Background</h5>

          <div class="section">
            Sydye ("us", "we", or "our") provides access to various application programming interfaces (each an
            “API”) to enable Participants and other persons (“Users”) to interface with its systems and/or markets 
            and generate STS-compliant, prepaid tokens.
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            These API General Terms & Conditions (the “General Terms”) set out the terms upon which we make its APIs available to Users.
            With respect to any individual API, these General Terms may from time to time be supplemented by
            special terms and conditions (the “Special Terms”). To the extent there is a conflict between these
            General Terms and the Special Terms applicable to an individual API, the relevant Special Terms will
            prevail. The General Terms and such Special Terms as are from time to time in force between us and a User shall 
            together be referred to as the “API User Agreement”.
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            The use of any one or more of the APIs by a User does not oblige us to make available any
            other API to such User.
          </div>

          <h5>Amendments to general terms</h5>

          <div class="section">
          We shall be entitled to amend the API User Agreement unilaterally from time to time. Following
          any such amendment an updated version of these General Terms or the relevant Special Terms, as
          the case may be, will be posted on this page at least 20 Banking Days prior to the day when
          the amended version comes into force.
          </div>

          <div class="section">
          Each User shall be deemed to accept such amendments through its continued use of the relevant API
          and/or Technical Information with effect from the date on which the amended version of the General
          Terms or Special Terms comes into force.
          </div>

          <h5>Access to Technical Information</h5>

          <div class="section">
          To facilitate the necessary system development by the User, we may, on request, make
          available to the User certain technical information relating to a specific API (the “Technical
          Information”).
          </div>
          <div class="section">
          The Technical Information is provided on an "as is" basis and without any warranty (express or implied).
          We disclaim all warranties including any implied warranty of merchantability and/or fitness for
          a particular purpose.
          </div>
          <div class="section">
          Each User that accesses the Technical Information for an API shall be bound by the terms of the API
          User Agreement from the moment such information is accessed.
          </div>


          <h5>System development testing</h5>

          <div class="section">
As soon as the User has completed the necessary system development with respect to an API, the
User will not need to engage us to arrange a system test since they will have full integration with the API, unless 
they are planning to allow token generation for more than 200 devices using the API, in which the User will engage with us for pricing.
          </div> 

          <div class="section">
After development and integration with the Platform, the User is solely responsible for
          </div>

<ol>

<li> the availability, functionality, operation and use of all other facilities needed to access and use the
relevant API, including any telecommunication lines, hardware equipment, operating platforms and
other software;</li>

data source) and any other information needed for the functionality of the API, and that such information meets the requirements needed for the functionality of the API;</li>

relating to any one or more of the APIs.
</div>


<h5>API Licence</h5>

<div class="section">
In consideration of the User becoming bound by and continuing to comply with the API User
Agreement, we grant to the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, worldwide, revocable right and license to use such API(s) as it requires to send and transmit data to the
extent necessary to interface with one or more of our systems and/or markets.
</div>

to the platform or other market participants, or is affecting our’s or other users’ use of the relevant

the relevant API, and immediately inform the User of such disconnection and/or suspension.

ensure that older versions of any APIs will remain functional, but does not warrant or guarantee that
this will be possible.
